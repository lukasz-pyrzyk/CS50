1. What is pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis?
It's the longest word in english dictionary

2. According to its man page, what does getrusage do?
It returns usage of the given resource

3. Per that same man page, how many members are in a variable of type struct rusage?
16

4. Why do you think we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though we’re not changing their contents?
This structure is quite big, so copying data might be slow. By passing data via reference, program is faster.

5. Explain as precisely as possible, in a paragraph or more, how main goes about reading words from a file. In other words, convince us that you indeed understand how that function’s for loop works.
Program reads character from stream until stream is empty (EOF). Each character is analyzed by following if statemets:
1 - If the character is an alphabetical or an apostrophe that is not at starting index of the word, loaded char is added to array for specific word
2 - If the character is numerical, the word is ignored
3 - Then char is space or punctuation, we must finish the word array by adding \0

6. Why do you think we used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf with a format string like "%s" to read whole words at a time? Put another way, what problems might arise by relying on fscanf alone?
It is safer way, because program might be attacked by passing very long word like aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa [...] without any whitespace. It might cause many overflows or overwrite another pieces of program.

7. Why do you think we declared the parameters for check and load as const (which means "constant")?
Those pointers cannot be change in any way. This is a safer way of passing data, because we don't allow to modify the data in different places.
Also, compiler is able to optimizer method call upfront, because it knows that we won't modify this data.

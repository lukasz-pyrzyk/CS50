1.  What’s stdint.h?  
    It is header file that allows developer to write program which depends on the types size safetely.

2.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    Those types give fixed-width integers. They are needed when we need to depend on the size of integer between different platforms.

3.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    On 32bit architecture: 
    BYTE - 1 byte
    DWORD - 4 bytes
    LONG - 4 bytes
    WORD - 2 bytes

4.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    BM tag is used to determine bitmap

5.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize - total number of bytes in the file
    biSize - number of bytes in the header

6.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    Bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

7.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount

8.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    In case of any error, like missing file

9.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    It determines how many elements we want to read into the structure. In our case, we want to read one structure

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    3 pixels with 3 bytes gives 9 byte, but we need to have 12

11. What does fseek do?
    It moves the cursor into the specific place in stream

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
    It moves file pointer position to given location.
